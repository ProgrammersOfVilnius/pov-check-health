SYNOPSIS
========

**check-health** [**-v**] [**-f** *configfile*]

**check-health** **-g** > *configfile*

**check-health** **-h**


DESCRIPTION
===========

**check-health** is a "poor man's Nagios": a script that performs some
basic system health checks.  The checks are specified in the configuration
file ``/etc/pov/check-health``; if that file doesn't exist,
**check-health** will exit silently without checking anything.

You can run ``check-health -g`` to generate a config file.  You'll probably
need to modify it to suit your needs.

Usually **check-health** is run automatically from cron.  It doesn't emit
any output and returns exit code 0 if all checks pass.  Any output
indicates an error, and cron emails it to ``root``.


OPTIONS
=======

-h           Print brief usage message and exit.
-v           Verbose output: show what checks are being performed.
-g           Generate a sample config file and print it to stdout.
-f FILENAME  Use the specified config file instead of ``/etc/pov/check-health``.


AVAILABLE CHECKS
================

.. documentation generated by running ./extract-documentation.py

checkuptime [<uptime>[s/m/h/sec/min/hour]]
  Skip the rest of the checks if system uptime is less than N
  seconds/minutes/hours.

  <uptime> defaults to 10 minutes.


  Example: ``checkuptime 10m``


checkfs <mountpoint> [<amount>[K/M/G/T]]
  Check that the filesystem mounted on <mountpoint> has at least <amount>
  of metric kilo/mega/giga/terabytes free.

  <amount> defaults to 1M.


  Example: ``checkfs / 100M``


checkinodes <mountpoint> [<inodes>]
  Check that the filesystem mounted on <mountpoint> has at least <inodes>
  of free inodes left.

  <inodes> defaults to 5000.


  Example: ``checkinodes /``


checknfs <mountpoint>
  Check that an NFS file system is mounted on <mountpoint>.

  If not, try to mount all NFS filesystems.

  Used as a workaround for an Ubuntu issue where NFS filesystems would fail
  to mount during boot, but would mount fine afterwards.

  This hasn't been a problem lately.


  Example: ``checknfs /home``


checkpidfile <filename>
  Check that the process listed in a given pidfile is running.


  Example: ``checkpidfile /var/run/crond.pid``


checkpidfiles <filename> ...
  Check that the processes listed in given pidfiles are running.

  Suppresses warnings for /var/run/sm-notify.pid because it feels like a
  false positive.

  Suppresses warnings for failed glob expansion under /run or /var/run.


  Example: ``checkpidfiles /var/run/*.pid /var/run/*/*.pid``


checkproc <name>
  Check that a process with a given name is running.

  See also: checkproc_pgrep, checkproc_pgrep_full.


  Example: ``checkproc crond``


checkproc_pgrep <name>
  Check that a process with a given name is running.

  Uses pgrep instead of pidof.


  Example: ``checkproc_pgrep tracd``


checkproc_pgrep_full <cmdline>
  Check that a process matching a given command line is running.

  Uses pgrep -f instead of pidof, which makes it handle all sorts of things.


  Example: ``checkproc_pgrep_full scriptname.py``

  Example: ``checkproc_pgrep_full '/usr/bin/java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war'``


checktoomanyproc <name> <limit>
  Check that fewer than <limit> instances of a given process is running.


  Example: ``checktoomanyproc aspell 2``


checkram [<free>[M/G/T]]
  Check that at least <free> metric mega/giga/terabytes of virtual memory are
  free.

  <free> defaults to 100 megabytes.


  Example: ``checkram 100M``


checkswap [<limit>[M/G/T]]
  Check if more than <limit> metric mega/giga/terabytes of swap are used.

  <limit> defaults to 100 megabytes.


  Example: ``checkswap 2G``


checkmailq [<limit>]
  Check if more than <limit> emails are waiting in the outgoing mail queue.

  <limit> defaults to 20.

  The check is silently skipped if you don't have any MTA (that provides a
  mailq command) installed.  Otherwise it probably works only with Postfix.


  Example: ``checkmailq 100``


checkzopemailq <path> ...
  Check if any messages older than one minute are present in the outgoing
  maildir used by zope.sendmail.

  <path> needs to refer to the 'new' subdirectory of the mail queue.


  Example: ``checkzopemailq /apps/zopes/*/var/mailqueue/new``


checkcups <queuename>
  Check if the printer is ready.

  Try to enable it if it became disabled.

  Background: I had this issue with CUPS randomly disabling a particular mail
  queue after it couldn't talk to the printer for a while due to network
  issues or something.  Manually reenabling the printer got old fast.
  This hasn't been a problem lately.


  Example: ``checkcups cheese``


cmpfiles <pathname1> <pathname2>
  Check if the two files are identical.

  Background: there were some init.d scripts that were writable by a non-root
  user.  I wanted to do manual inspection before replacing copies of them
  into /etc/init.d/.


  Example: ``cmpfiles /etc/init.d/someservice /home/someservice/initscript``


checkaliases
  Check if /etc/aliases.db is up to date.

  Probably works only with Postfix, and only if you use the default database
  format.

  Background: when you edit /etc/aliases it's so easy to forget to run
  newaliases.


  Example: ``checkaliases``


checklilo
  Check if LILO was run after a kernel update.

  Background: if you don't re-run LILO after you update your kernel, your
  machine will not boot.  We had to use LILO on one server because GRUB
  completely refused to boot from the Software RAID-1 root partition.


  Example: ``checklilo``

EXAMPLES
========

Example ``/etc/pov/check-health``::

    # Check that processes are running
    checkproc apache2
    checkproc cron
    checkproc sshd
    checkproc_pgrep tracd
    checkproc_pgrep_full '/usr/bin/java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war'

    # Check for stale aspell processes (more than 2)
    checktoomanyproc aspell 2

    # Check for stale pidfiles
    checkpidfiles /var/run/*.pid /var/run/*/*.pid

    # Check free disk space
    checkfs /    200M
    checkfs /var 200M

    # Check free inodes
    checkinodes /
    checkinodes /var

    # Check free memory
    checkram 100M

    # Check excessive swap usage
    checkswap 2G

    # Check mail queue
    checkmailq 100

    # Check if /etc/aliases is up to date
    checkaliases


BUGS
====

**check-health** returns exit code 0 even if some checks failed.  You need
to watch stderr to notice problems.

Many checks don't check their arguments for correctness and may fail in
unexpected ways if you supply a wrong value (or neglect to supply a value
where one was expected).


DESIGN LIMITATIONS
==================

If cron doesn't work, or email sending doesn't work, **check-health**
won't be able to report problems.

**check-health** is stateless and as such will keep reporting the same
error once an hour (assuming default cron configuration) until you fix it.
